Such opportunistic biting has been observed in nocturnal mosquitoes disturbed by day. The activation step is readily observed in the laboratory but has seldom been described from the field.

Conspecific females individually fly to these swarms, but little is known of the responses that take them there. At the assembly stations where male and female insects meet, the females usually are recognized by vision, and among insects that form aerial swarms the eyes of the male are specially developed." [ISBN:0-85199-313-3]
comment: Among some families of Culicimorpha, including the Culicidae, the eyes of males are not especially developed but certain auditory organs are, and the detection of females depends upon hearing. In these flies, the verticillate antennae and highly developed Johnston's organs mediate a sensitivity to the flight tone of conspecific females.\nStation-keeping swarms are formed by the members of certain families of Diptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera, and to a lesser extend by representatives of the Hymenoptera and a few other insect orders. The assembly station is attended by both sexes, but usually the males fly there for long periods whareas the females remain only long enough to mate(Sivinski amd Petersson, 1997).

comment: These males have a well developed Johnston's organ, and it is likely that in most of these species the females' wing tone is an important cue for the final orientation of males to a female.\nWe may note here the assembly of males at the feeding site of a non-blood-sucking mosquito. Females of the autogenous species Malaya leei hover over a procession of ants on a tree trunk and, from time to time, settle to obtain regutgitated fluid from an ant. Males often appeared behind the hovering females and mated with them , completing the act within few seconds.

In Culiseta they are known from annulata and incidens of subgenus Culiseta, and longiareolata of subgenus Allotheobaldia. In Uranotaenia they are known from anhydor of subgenus Pseudoficalbia. Chemical analysis revealed the oviposition aggregation pheromone of Culex quinquefasciatus to be the (-)-(5R,6S) stereoisomer of the fatty-acid lactone 6-acetoxy-5-hexadecanolide.

All mosquito swarms have 3 characteristics in common: 1) The individual members of a swarm fly in looping or zig-zag patterns characteristic of the species, and all keep within a limited space that is located in relation to some feature of the environment. 2) The swarms consist predominately of males. When conspecifics females enter a swarm, males approach and attempt to couple with them. 3) Swarming is limited to times of day characteristic of the species, usually close to dusk and dawn.

def: "Oocytes that have reached stage V and are ready for ovulation are often described as mature, yet their chromosomes are still in the metaphase of the first meiotic division. Meiosis is resumed only after the oocytes have been penetrated by sperm at oviposition. Thus the oocytes are held in a state of nuclear stasis from the time they are ready for ovulation until syngamy stimulates completion of the maturation divisions. The maturation resting stage normally lasts only a few hours, until the appropriate activity rhythm leads to ovulation and oviposition. However, if females are unable to oviposit, the stage V oocytes can remain viable within ovaries for 15days or even more." [ISBN:0-412-40180-0]

Once the labellar lobes have parted, the oral surfaces of the ladella lie flat on the droplet and the external surfaces face away from it. The fluid immediately spreads over the hydrophilic oral surfaces of the labella and their chemosensilla, and over the ligul, submerging the tip of the labrum.

comment: The flight-activity periodicities of captive females of a number of crepuscular/nocturnal species changed, and came to resemble the periodicities of man-biting activity in wild populations. One effect is on the phase of the flight-activity rhythm. It is suggested that a factor in the semen of the males of the autogenous strains suppressed blood-feeding by the nulliparous females of these strains. In some species, virgin females are less responsive to host cues than inseminated females. Another effect is the inhibition of responsiveness to host cues in females due to male accessory-gland secretion.

comment: Has_participant is a primitive instance-level relation between a process, a continuant, and a time at which the continuant participates in some way in the process. The relation obtains, for example, when this particular process of oxygen exchange across this particular alveolar membrane has_participant this particular sample of hemoglobin at this particular time.

comment: An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.   The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.

comment: The process of 'histidine catabolism' (GO:0006548) realizes the function 'histidine ammonia lyase activity' (GO:0004397) (note: here 'activity' denotes a function and not a process). We leave open the possibility of defining in future the sub-relations directly_realizes (as bewteen a function and it's functioning) and indirectly_realizes.
